#if we ls or ls -la we will see a sshkey saying "bandit26.sshkey "
#let's use it to log in. Weeeee

ssh -i ./bandit26.sshkey bandit26@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p2220

#When to log in, it automatically logs you out. Fun times.
#maybe we can just cat it before kicking us out
#when we are kicked out, we are sent back to user bandit25
#lets cat /etc/pssqd | grep bandit26

cat /etc/passwd | grep bandit26

#it will show a file saying /usr/bin/showtext
#let's cat it

cat /usr/bin/showtext

#it says it wants to show more text
#we can manually shrink the size of the terminal to as small as we can get it
#then log in using the we tried earlier

ssh -i ./bandit26.sshkey bandit26@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p2220

#it will now let us in but we need to make a vim
#press v

v

#takes us into vim shell type in


#type :r (to run console) and then /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26 to get the level 26 password

:r /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26

#and there is our password ' 5czgV9L3Xx8JPOyRbXh6lQbmIOWvPT6Z '
#that was crazy
